## Introduction

For my Code Institute Portfolio Project 5, 
I would like to implement an E-Commerce online shop in order for shoppers to purchase Christian posters.
This project is built from the perspective of a small business owner who wants a website to attract customers to his Guitar Tech business. 
The website will operate as a Business to Consumer (B2C) E-Commerce site, allowing the selling of posters from the business, namely **Biblia Posters**, to individual consumers.
To meet this B2C requirement:
- the site will display a range of posters for customers to purchase
- the site will have the necessary functionality to allow users to purchase the posters online
- the site will allow users to subscribe to an email newsletter
- the site will allow a user to set up their own profile to facilitate future purchases
- the site will allow registered users to add posters to their own wish list for future purchases
- the site will allow registered users to share reviews about their purchases and interactions with Biblia Poster
- depending on a particular time of the year, the site will offer users discounts on events of special Biblical significance

## Deployment

The project is deployed on Render.<br> 
All credit goes to Sophia Iroegbu and her tutorial [How to Deploy a Django App on Render](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/deploying-a-django-app-to-render/) which worked flawlessly.<br><br>
These are the steps in order to deploy on Render:
1. Regarding your project - ensure you have PostgreSQL Database setup - for my project, [ElephantSQL Postgres](https://www.elephantsql.com/) was used
     + However alternatively there is an option to create a PostgreSQL database within Render
2. Create a Render account - either via Github itself or use your own email address
   - Either way, you will need to use your email address to confirm registration with Render
3. Once you have signed up, then proceed to Set Up a PostgreSQL Database if no setup already exists <br>- *skip Steps 3,5,6 if you already have a Database setup*
   - go to the Render dashboard and Click the **New +** button, hover over **PostgreSQL**, and click it
   - Next, define your database settings by giving your *database instance* a unique name
   - For **Region**, use **Frankfurt (EU Central)** if you are based in Europe
   - Select the free tier and click on **Create Database**
   - Once the status on your database shows **Available**, it means the database has been successfully created and is ready to use
   - Scroll down this page to see your database settings. You will need the **External Database URL**
4. Once the database is set up, you need to connect it to your Django project
   - Install dj-database-url by running the command
   - **pip install dj-database-url**
5. If you created your Postgres Database setup within Render, <br>then head over to your database settings on Render and copy the **External Database URL**
6. Copy this into your **env.py** i.e. **os.environ["DATABASE_URL"]="postgres:// ..."**
- Note: There is no need to do this step, if **os.environ["DATABASE_URL"]** already contains the URL of a previous, working database
7. Ensure that in your *settings.py* under your sitename the following settings are at the top of the file:
  ```
  import dj-database-url
  import os

  DATABASES = {
	"default": dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get("DATABASE_URL"))
  }
   ```
8. Confirm everything is installed correctly by running **pip3 install -r requirements.txt**
9. Next, migrate your tables to your new database to ensure the connection was successful
   - **python manage.py makemigrations**
   - **python manage.py migrate**
10. Create a folder in the root directory called **staticfiles**
11. Populate this folder by running **python manage.py collectstatic --noinput**
12. Push your codebase to your Git repo
13. Head over to your Render dashboard. Click **New +** and **Select Web web-service-name**
14. Connect your GitHub if you haven't already
    - This is done by: **Search** for the repo you want to deploy and click the **Connect** button
15. Give your **web web-service-name** a name and ensure you are connecting to the right branch
   - Use the same **Region** as used earlier
   - Build command should be: **pip install -r requirements.txt**
   - Start command should be: **gunicorn \<sitename\>.wsgi**
   - (Note: this would be the same entry that follows the word **web:** in a Heroku Procfile; although a Procfile is **not** needed by Render)
   - Select the free tier and click on **Create Web Service**
16. Copy the **\<web-service-name\>.com** name that was chosen - that is, *No https://, No URL* - simply **\<web-service-name\>.com**
   - Enter that into ALLOWED_HOSTS
   - The entry should be:
   - ```
     ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['\<web-service-name\>.com', ...]
     Ensure
     DEBUG = False
     ```
17. Push your codebase to your Git repo
18. Once that is done, on the left hand column, click Environment
   - This is where you enter the contents of **env.py**
   - You do this by selecting by going to the **Secret Files** option
   - Under **Filename**, enter **env.py**
   - Under **Contents** copy and paste the contents of **env.py** into the box provided
   - Then click **Save Changes**
19. Everything should now be set up for deployment i.e. the database name, the 'secret' environment variables, <br>the *render.com web service name*
20. At the top right of the Render Dashboard, click **Manual Deploy** then **Deploy latest commit**
21. The date, time and *Building In progress* spinner will be displayed
21. Ensure there are no errors. Render will display the message **Your service is live** in the log,<br>whilst above the log, the word **Live** will be shown in green
22. Click the URL link of the form **https:\/\/\<web-service-name>.onrender.com/**

### How to Fork the Repository
1. Log in (or sign up) to Github.
2. Go to the TODO repository on GitHub.
3. Click the "Fork" button in the top right corner.

### How to Clone the Repository
1. Log in (or sign up) to Github.
2. Go to the TODO repository on GitHub.
3. Click on the code button, select whether you would like to clone with HTTPS, SSH or GitHub CLI and copy the link shown.
4. Open the terminal in your code editor and change the current working directory to the location you want to use for the cloned directory.
5. Type 'git clone' into the terminal and then paste the link you copied in step 3. Press enter.
